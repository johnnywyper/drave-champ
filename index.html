		  <p>Draven is a champion in the online game League of Legends. He is a ruthless and arrogant executioner who wields two spinning axes as his primary weapons. Draven's playstyle is focused on dealing damage and overwhelming opponents with his raw power.</p>
		  <p>In Noxus, warriors known as reckoners face one another in arenas where blood is spilled and strength testedâ€”but none has ever been as celebrated as Draven. A former soldier, he found that the crowds uniquely appreciated his flair for the dramatic, not to mention the spray of blood from each of his spinning axes. Addicted to the spectacle of his own brash perfection, Draven has sworn to defeat whomever he must to ensure that his name is chanted throughout the empire forever more.</p>
